##### Fine-tuning Llama 3.2 1B Instruct on the RecipesNLG dataset

Following https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_finetune_chat_models, we fine-tune our own instance of LLama 3.2 Instruct.
Our approach is purely `torch` based. Model weights were obtained from https://www.llama.com/models/llama-3/.
